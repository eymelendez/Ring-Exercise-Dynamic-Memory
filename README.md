# Ring-Exercise-Dynamic-Memory

 A  ring  is a collection of items that has a reference to a current item. An operation—let’s call it advance—moves the reference to the next item in the collection. When the reference reaches the last item, the next advance operation moves the reference back to the ﬁ rst item. A ring also has operations to get the current item, add an item, and remove an item. The details of where an item is added and which item is removed are up to you.
